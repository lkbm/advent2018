# My Advent of Code 2018 Solutions
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a month-long programming puzzle challenge.

Herein, I'm solving the 2018 puzzles using Python3, because:
1. I like Python.
2. Jeez, I'm so bad at Python.
3. Doing it in a language I don't know would be even more work, and I'm expecting to quit after a few days anyway because really, Luca, you're taking on extra homework?

My goals/metrics are something along the lines of:
1. Complete the tasks each day
2. ...with clean, readable code
3. ...that also runs reasonably efficiently
4. ...and is slightly more robust than is strictly necessary, but keeping the error handling to a sane level.

If I feel like I need to do more work, maybe I'll even write some tests.
